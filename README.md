# Upload streams

This is a mini passion project showing how data can be streamed in chunks from the client to the server using a websocket implementation instead of the standard REST way of doing things.

## Workflow

The workflow demonstrated by this app goes as follows:

1. Client chooses a file from their filesystem and clicks **Upload**
2. A unique **Session ID** is generated, then sent to the server with the **begin_upload** event. A response from the server is awaited before moving onto the next step.
3. While the client waits, the server prepares a stream that will listen for events named **upload_chunk_{SESSION-ID}**. Then, a response is sent to the client acknowledging that the server is now ready to start receiving data.
4. The client sends each chunk of the file by emitting the **upload_chunk_{SESSION-ID}** event. It waits for the server to acknowledge that the chunk has been processed before sending the next one.
5. Once the server has received the last chunk, it emits the **upload_success_{SESSION-ID}** to the client and the **File uploaded successfully** message is displayed to the user.

## Setup

Ensure that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and that the Docker daemon is running on your machine. Then, within the project's directory, run the following command:

```shell
docker compose up --build -d
```
